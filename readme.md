cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin ![CI status](https://travis-ci.org/temyers/cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin.svg?branch=master)
============================

A common approach for running Cucumber features in parallel is to create a suite of Cucumber runners, one for each suite of tests you wish to run in parallel.  For maximum parallelism, there should be a runner per feature file.

This is a pain to maintain and not very DRY.

This is where the cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin comes in.  This plugin automatically generates a Cucumber JUnit or TestNG runner for each scenario/feature file found in your project.

Usage
-----

Add the following to your POM file:

        <featuresDirectory>src/test/resources/features/</featuresDirectory>
        <!-- Directory where the cucumber report files shall be written  -->
        <cucumberOutputDir>target/cucumber-parallel</cucumberOutputDir>
        <!-- comma separated list of output formats -->

        <!-- The tags to run, maps to CucumberOptions.tags property -->
        <tags></tags>
        <!-- If set to true, only feature files containing the required tags shall be generated. -->
        <filterFeaturesByTags>false</filterFeaturesByTags>
        <!-- Generate TestNG runners instead of JUnit ones. --> 
        <useTestNG>false</useTestNG>
        <!-- The naming scheme to use for the generated test classes.  One of 'simple' or 'feature-title' --> 
        <namingScheme>simple</namingScheme>
        <!-- The class naming pattern to use.  Only required/used if naming scheme is 'pattern'.-->
        <namingPattern>Parallel{c}IT</namingPattern>
        <!-- One of [SCENARIO, FEATURE]. SCENARIO generates one runner per scenario.  FEATURE generates a runner per feature. -->
        <parallelScheme>SCENARIO</parallelScheme>
        <!-- Specify a custom template for the generated sources (this is a path relative to the project base directory) -->
        <customVmTemplate>src/test/resources/cucumber-custom-runner.vm</customVmTemplate>
        <!-- Specify a custom package name for generated sources. Default is no package.-->
        <packageName></packageName>
        <!-- Specify count from 1 to 5 to enable re-run functionality, by default it is 0 if not specified-->
        <retryCount>0</retryCount>
      </configuration>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

If `cucumber.options` VM argument is specified as per the [Cucumber CLI options](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/jvm), they shall override the configuration tags.

Where glue is a comma separated list of package names to use for the Cucumber Glue.

The plugin will search `featuresDirectory` for `*.feature` files and generate a JUnit test for each one. 
> **WARNING:** `featuresDirectory` must denote a directory within the root of the classpath.
> **Example:** 
> * Resources in `src/test/resources` are added to the classpath by default.
> * `src/test/resources/features` **is** in the root of the classpath, so **would be valid** for `featuresDirectory`
> * `src/test/resources/features/sub_folder` is **not** in the root of the classpath, so **would not be valid** to put in `featuresDirectory`

If you prefer to generate TestNG tests, set `useTestNG` to true

The Java source is generated in `outputDirectory`, based on the naming scheme used.

Each runner is configured to output the results to a separate output file under `target/cucumber-parallel`

###Naming Scheme

The naming scheme used for the generated files is controlled by the `namingScheme` property.  The following values are supported:

| Property      | Generated Name |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| simple        | `ParallelXXIT.java`, where `XX` is a one up counter.
| feature-title | The name is generated based on the feature title with the following rules to ensure it is a valid classname:
* Spaces are removed, camel-casing the title.
* If the feature file starts with a digit, the classname is prefixed with '_'
* A on up counter is appended to the classname, to prevent clashes. |
| pattern       | Generate the filename based on the `namingPattern` property.  
The following tokens can be used in the pattern:
* `{f}` Converts the feature file name to a valid class name using the rules for feature-title, apart from the one up counter.
* `{c}` Adds a one up counter. |

By default, generated test files use the `simple` naming strategy.

####Note on Pattern Naming Scheme
The `pattern` naming scheme is for advanced usage only.  

It is up to you to ensure that class names generated are valid and there are no clashes.  If the same class name is generated multiple times, then it shall be overwritten and some of your tests will not be executed.

The `namingPattern` property is for the **class name** only.  Do not add the `.java` suffix.

###Re-Run Functionality

* **Why it's bad to keep re-running more than 1 or more time ?**
When we run test cases first time, we got some failure due to environment issues or network issues or grid management issues or Browsers issues such test cases we do not considering as **Flaky**, but if we are running again and again and getting same failure result on each run such test cases considered as Flaky, It is useless to keep re-running such test cases, Hence with the help of this plugin you can try only max 5 time.

* **What it does?**
It re-run only failed test cases on each run and after complete run it generate consolidated report.

* **How to enable it?:**
specify retryCount property counts between 1 to 5. `<retryCount>1</retryCount>`

* **Dependency required for this functionality:**
```
<!-- Required for ExtendedRuntimeOption, if user executing by mvn command which avoids resetting of mvn parameters.-->

  <artifactId>cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>same version of this plugin</version>
</dependency>
<!-- Required for generating consolidate reports of all run at one place-->
<dependency>

FAQ
===
Q. Why isn't there much activity on this project

A. The plugin is considered feature complete.  If you feel there is something missing, raise an issue.

Migration from version 1.x
==========================
* The default for the `tags` property is now set to no tags.  This means that all scenarios shall be executed by default.  
      If you did not specify the tags parameter, add `<tags>"@complete", "@accepted"</tags>` to the configuration section.
* A new property `parallelScheme` has been introduced to provide a mechanism for choosing how the feature runners are created.  The default is set to SCENARIO, meaning that a runner will be created for each scenario in a feature file, including any examples.  This greatly increases the possibility for running scenarios in parallel, but has the impact that any fragile, interdependent, tests may fail unexpectedly.  Use the FEATURE property to generate runners as per 1.x

Contributing
============

To contribute:

* Create an integration test to demonstrate the behaviour under `src/it/`.  For example, to add support for multiple output formats for junit runners:
    * Create `src/it/junit/multiple-format`
    * copy the contents of the `src/it/junit/simple-it` directory and update the `pom/src` as appropriate to demonstrate the configuration.  Update `verify.groovy` to implement the test for your feature.
    * Run `mvn clean install -Prun-its` to run the integration tests.
* Implement the feature
* When all tests are passing, submit a pull request.
* Coding standards, based on the [Google Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide) are enforced using Checkstyle.  Formatters for Eclipse and IntelliJ are provided in the `doc/style` folder

Once the pull request has been merged, a new release will be performed as soon as practicable.

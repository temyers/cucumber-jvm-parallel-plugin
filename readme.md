cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin ![CI status](https://travis-ci.org/temyers/cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin.svg?branch=master)
============================

A common approach for running Cucumber features in parallel is to create a suite of Cucumber runners, one for each suite of tests you wish to run in parallel.  For maximum parallelism, there should be a runner per feature file.

This is a pain to maintain and not very DRY.

This is where the cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin comes in.  This plugin automatically generates a Cucumber JUnit or TestNG runner for each scenario/feature file found in your project.

Usage
-----

Add the following to your POM file:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.github.temyers</groupId>
  <artifactId>cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>4.0.0</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>generateRunners</id>
      <phase>generate-test-sources</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>generateRunners</goal>
      </goals>
      <configuration>
        <!-- Mandatory -->
        <!-- List of package names to scan for glue code. -->
        <glue>
          <package>com.example</package>
          <package>com.example.other</package>
        </glue>
        <!-- These are optional, with the default values -->
        <!-- Where to output the generated tests -->
        <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/generated-test-sources/cucumber</outputDirectory>
        <!-- The directory, which must be in the root of the runtime classpath, containing your feature files.  -->
        <featuresDirectory>src/test/resources/features/</featuresDirectory>
        <!-- Directory where the cucumber report files shall be written  -->
        <cucumberOutputDir>target/cucumber-parallel</cucumberOutputDir>
        <!-- List of cucumber plugins. When none are provided the json formatter is used. For more 
             advanced usage see section about configuring cucumber plugins -->

              <name>json</name>
          </plugin>
          <plugin>
              <name>com.example.CustomHtmlFormatter</name>
              <extension>html</extension>
          </plugin>
        </plugins>
        <!-- CucumberOptions.strict property -->
        <strict>true</strict>
        <!-- CucumberOptions.monochrome property -->
        <monochrome>true</monochrome>
        <!-- The tags to run, maps to CucumberOptions.tags property. Default is no tags. -->
        <tags>
          <tag>@billing</tag>
          <tag>~@billing</tag>
          <tag>@important</tag>
          <tag>@important,@billing</tag>
        </tags>
        <!-- If set to true, only feature files containing the required tags shall be generated. -->
        <filterFeaturesByTags>false</filterFeaturesByTags>
        <!-- Generate TestNG runners instead of JUnit ones. --> 
        <useTestNG>false</useTestNG>
        <!-- The naming scheme to use for the generated test classes.  One of 'simple' or 'feature-title' --> 
        <namingScheme>simple</namingScheme>
        <!-- The class naming pattern to use.  Only required/used if naming scheme is 'pattern'.-->
        <namingPattern>Parallel{c}IT</namingPattern>
        <!-- One of [SCENARIO, FEATURE]. SCENARIO generates one runner per scenario.  FEATURE generates a runner per feature. -->
        <parallelScheme>SCENARIO</parallelScheme>
        <!-- Specify a custom template for the generated sources (this is a path relative to the project base directory) -->
        <customVmTemplate>src/test/resources/cucumber-custom-runner.vm</customVmTemplate>
        <!-- Specify a custom package name for generated sources. Default is no package.-->
        <packageName>com.example</packageName>
      </configuration>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

If `cucumber.options` VM argument is specified as per the [Cucumber CLI options](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/jvm), they shall override the configuration tags.

Where glue is a comma separated list of package names to use for the Cucumber Glue.

The plugin will search `featuresDirectory` for `*.feature` files and generate a JUnit test for each one. 
> **WARNING:** `featuresDirectory` must denote a directory within the root of the classpath.
> **Example:** 
> * Resources in `src/test/resources` are added to the classpath by default.
> * `src/test/resources/features` **is** in the root of the classpath, so **would be valid** for `featuresDirectory`
> * `src/test/resources/features/sub_folder` is **not** in the root of the classpath, so **would not be valid** to put in `featuresDirectory`

If you prefer to generate TestNG tests, set `useTestNG` to true

The Java source is generated in `outputDirectory`, based on the naming scheme used.

Each runner is configured to output the results to a separate output file under `target/cucumber-parallel`

### Cucumber Plugins ###

Cucumber plugins that write to a file are referenced using the syntax 
`name[:outputDirectory/excutorId[.extension]]`. Because not all plugins create output and the 
excutorId is provided at runtime some leg work is needed.

#### Build-in Cucumber Plugins ####

```xml
<plugins>
    <plugin>
        <!--The available options are junit, testng, html, pretty, json, usage and rerun -->
        <name>json</name>
        <!--Optional file extension. For build in cucumber plugins a sensible default is provided. -->
        <extension>json</extension>
        <!--Optional output directory. Overrides cucumberOutputDirectory. Usefull when different 
            plugins create files with the same extension-->
        <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/cucumber-parallel/json</outputDirectory>
    </plugin>
</plugins>
```

#### Custom Cucumber Plugins ####

```xml
<plugins>
    <plugin>
        <name>path.to.my.formaters.CustomHtmlFormatter</name>
        <!--Optional file extension. Unless the formatter writes to a file it is strongly 
            recommend that one is provided. -->
        <extension>html</extension>
        <!--Optional output directory. Overrides cucumberOutputDirectory. Useful when different 
            plugins create files with the same extension-->
        <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/cucumber-parallel/html</outputDirectory>
    </plugin>
</plugins>
```

#### Custom Cucumber Plugins without output ####

```xml
<plugins>
    <plugin>
        <name>path.to.my.formaters.NoOutputFormatter</name>
        <!--Set to true if this plug creates no output. Setting extension or outputDirectory 
            will override this setting -->
        <noOutput>true</noOutput>
    </plugin>
</plugins>
```

### Naming Scheme ###

The naming scheme used for the generated files is controlled by the `namingScheme` property.  The following values are supported:

| Property      | Generated Name |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| simple        | `ParallelXXIT.java`, where `XX` is a one up counter.
| feature-title | The name is generated based on the feature title with the following rules to ensure it is a valid classname:
* Spaces are removed, camel-casing the title.
* If the feature file starts with a digit, the classname is prefixed with '_'
* A on up counter is appended to the classname, to prevent clashes. |
| pattern       | Generate the filename based on the `namingPattern` property.  
The following tokens can be used in the pattern:
* `{f}` Converts the feature file name to a valid class name using the rules for feature-title, apart from the one up counter.
* `{c}` Adds a one up counter. |

By default, generated test files use the `simple` naming strategy.

#### Note on Pattern Naming Scheme ####
The `pattern` naming scheme is for advanced usage only.  

It is up to you to ensure that class names generated are valid and there are no clashes.  If the same class name is generated multiple times, then it shall be overwritten and some of your tests will not be executed.

The `namingPattern` property is for the **class name** only.  Do not add the `.java` suffix.

### Custom Templates ###

Some reporting plugins, such as
[Cucumber Extent Reporter](https://github.com/email2vimalraj/CucumberExtentReporter), require some 
setup before a test is started. A template can be used to customize the integration tests. For a 
sample see the [extents-report](src/it/junit/extents-report) integration test.


FAQ
===
Q. Why isn't there much activity on this project

A. The plugin is considered feature complete.  If you feel there is something missing, raise an issue.


Migration from version 3.x
==========================
* The `filterFeaturesByTags` property has been removed. If you have not set this property to true 
  remove any tags from your configuration. If you have set it to true you  can safely remove it.


Migration from version 2.x
==========================
* The `glue` property now takes a list of `package` elements rather then a list of comma delimited packages. A 
  `package` contains a single package name to be used as glue.
* The `tags` property now takes a list of `tag` elements rather then a list of comma and quote delimited strings. A 
  `tag` element can take one or more tags. The semantics are the same as those of the
  [the command line]( https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Tags#running-a-subset-of-scenarios).
* The default value for `cucumberOutputDir` has changed from `target/cucumber-parallel` to 
  `${project.build.directory}/cucumber-parallel` if you were using a build directory other then `target` you can remove 
  this element.


Migration from version 1.x
==========================
* The default for the `tags` property is now set to no tags.  This means that all scenarios shall be executed by default.  
      If you did not specify the tags parameter, add `<tags>"@complete", "@accepted"</tags>` to the configuration section.
* A new property `parallelScheme` has been introduced to provide a mechanism for choosing how the feature runners are created.  The default is set to SCENARIO, meaning that a runner will be created for each scenario in a feature file, including any examples.  This greatly increases the possibility for running scenarios in parallel, but has the impact that any fragile, interdependent, tests may fail unexpectedly.  Use the FEATURE property to generate runners as per 1.x

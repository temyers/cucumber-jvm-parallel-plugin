cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin ![CI status](https://travis-ci.org/temyers/cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin.svg?branch=master)
============================

A common approach for running Cucumber features in parallel is to create a suite of Cucumber runners, one for each suite of tests you wish to run in parallel.  For maximum parallelism, there should be a runner per feature file.

This is a pain to maintain and not very DRY.

This is where the cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin comes in.  This plugin automatically generates a Cucumber JUnit or TestNG runner for each feature file found in your project.

Usage
-----

Add the following to your POM file:

```xml
<dependencies>
  	<dependency>
  		<groupId>com.github.temyers</groupId>
		  <artifactId>cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin</artifactId>
		  <version>1.3.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  	</dependency>
</dependencies>

<plugin>
  <groupId>com.github.temyers</groupId>
  <artifactId>cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.1</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>generateRunners</id>
      <phase>validate</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>generateRunners</goal>
      </goals>
      <configuration>
          <!-- Mandatory -->
          <!-- comma separated list of package names to scan for glue code -->
         <glue>foo, bar</glue>
         <!-- These are the default values -->
          <!-- Where to output the generated tests -->
           <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/generated-test-sources/cucumber</outputDirectory>
           <!-- The diectory, which must be in the root of the runtime classpath, containing your feature files.  -->
          <featuresDirectory>src/test/resources/features/</featuresDirectory>
           <!-- Directory where the cucumber report files shall be written  -->
          <cucumberOutputDir>target/cucumber-parallel</cucumberOutputDir>
          <!-- comma separated list of output formats. For JUnit Rerun json,html,rerun are mandatory-->
         <format>json,html,rerun</format>
         <!-- CucumberOptions.strict property -->
         <strict>true</strict>
         <!-- CucumberOptions.monochrome property -->
         <monochrome>true</monochrome>
         <!-- The tags to run, maps to CucumberOptions.tags property -->
         <tags>"@complete", "@accepted"</tags>
         <!-- If set to true, only feature files containing the required tags shall be generated. -->
         <!-- Excluded tags (~@notMe) are ignored. -->
         <filterFeaturesByTags>false</filterFeaturesByTags>
         <!-- Generate TestNG runners instead of JUnit ones. --> 
         <useTestNG>false</useTestNG>
         <!-- The naming scheme to use for the generated test classes.  One of 'simple' or 'feature-title' --> 
         <namingScheme>simple</namingScheme>
         <!-- The class naming pattern to use.  Only required/used if naming scheme is 'pattern'.-->
         <namingPattern>Parallel{c}IT</namingPattern>
         <!-- It is meaningless to keep reruning without looking for root cause of the failure. Test case/features/scenarios won't pass magically so you can use max 5 rerun. -->
	     <retryCount>0</retryCount>
      </configuration>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

If `cucumber.options` VM argument is specified as per the [Cucumber CLI options](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/jvm), they shall override the configuration tags.

Where glue is a comma separated list of package names to use for the Cucumber Glue.

The plugin will search `featuresDirectory` for `*.feature` files and generate a JUnit test for each one. 
> **WARNING:** `featuresDirectory` must denote a directory within the root of the classpath.
> **Example:** 
> * Resources in `src/test/resources` are added to the classpath by default.
> * `src/test/resources/features` **is** in the root of the classpath, so **would be valid** for `featuresDirectory`
> * `src/test/resources/features/sub_folder` is **not** in the root of the classpath, so **would not be valid** to put in `featuresDirectory`

If you prefer to generate TestNG tests, set `useTestNG` to true

The Java source is generated in `outputDirectory`, based on the naming scheme used.

Each runner is configured to output the results to a separate output file under `target/cucumber-parallel`

###Naming Scheme

The naming scheme used for the generated files is controlled by the `namingScheme` property.  The following values are supported:

| Property      | Generated Name |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| simple        | `ParallelXXIT.java`, where `XX` is a one up counter.
| feature-title | The name is generated based on the feature title with the following rules to ensure it is a valid classname:
* Spaces are removed, camel-casing the title.
* If the feature file starts with a digit, the classname is prefixed with '_'
* A on up counter is appended to the classname, to prevent clashes. |
| pattern       | Generate the filename based on the `namingPattern` property.  
The following tokens can be used in the pattern:
* `{f}` Converts the feature file name to a valid class name using the rules for feature-title, apart from the one up counter.
* `{c}` Adds a one up counter. |

By default, generated test files use the `simple` naming strategy.

####Note on Pattern Naming Scheme
The `pattern` naming scheme is for advanced usage only.  

It is up to you to ensure that class names generated are valid and there are no clashes.  If the same class name is generated multiple times, then it shall be overwritten and some of your tests will not be executed.

The `namingPattern` property is for the **class name** only.  Do not add the `.java` suffix.

###Re-Run Functionality

> **Why it's bad to keep re-running more than 1 or more time ?:**
* When we run test cases first time, we got some failure due to environment issues or network issues or grid management issues or Browsers issues, such test cases we are not considering as **Flaky**.
 If we are getting same failure result on each run such test cases we count as Flaky, It is meaning less to keep running such test cases so with this plugin you can try only 5 times max.
> **What it does?:**
* It re-run only failed test cases on each run and after complete run it generate consolidated report.
> **How to enable it?:**
* specify property counts between 1 to 5.
```xml
<retryCount>1</retryCount>

Contributing
============

To contribute:

* Create an integration test to demonstrate the behaviour under `src/it/`.  For example, to add support for multiple output formats for junit runners:
    * Create src/it/junit/multiple-format
    * copy the contents of the src/it/junit/simple-it directory and update the pom/src as appropriate to demonstrate the configuration.  Update the verify.groovy to implement the test for your feature.
    * Run `mvn clean install -Prun-its` to run the integration tests.
* Implement the feature
* When all tests are passing, submit a pull request.

Once the pull request has been merged, a new release will be performed as soon as practicable.

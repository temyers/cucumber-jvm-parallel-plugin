Feature: Feature1

  Scenario: Generate Junit Runner for each feature file
    Given I have feature files
    When I generate Maven sources
    Then the file "target/generated-test-sources/1IT.java" should exist
    And it should contain:
    """
    @RunWith(Cucumber.class)
    @CucumberOptions(
        strict = true,
        features = {"classpath:features/feature2.feature"},
        format = {"json:target/cucumber-parallel/2.json", "pretty"},
        monochrome = false,
        tags = {"@complete", "@accepted"},
        glue = {"foo", "bar"})
    public class Parallel02IT {
    }
    """
